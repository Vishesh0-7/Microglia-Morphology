# Microglia Morphology Analysis

This repository contains machine learning pipelines for analyzing microglia morphology using multimodal data.

## Dataset

**Note:** The dataset used in this project cannot be uploaded to this repository due to permission constraints. The data remains private and is subject to access restrictions set by the data owners.

The dataset includes:
- Cell body images
- Skeleton images
- Morphological features

If you wish to replicate or use this code with your own data, please ensure your data follows a similar structure to what's expected by the pipelines.

## Project Structure

- **Unsupervised/**: Unsupervised learning pipeline using autoencoders for feature extraction and clustering
- **Supervised/**: Supervised classification pipeline for microglia morphology
- **Denoising/**: Denoising autoencoder implementation

Please refer to the README files in each subdirectory for detailed information about each pipeline.
